### Task 1: Introduction to Histogram Equalization

#### Objective:
Understand the basics of histogram equalization and its impact on image contrast.

#### 1. Load and Display an Image:
- **Load a grayscale image and display it.**
- **Plot the histogram** of the original image to show the distribution of pixel intensities.

#### 2. Calculate and Plot Histogram:
- **Calculate the histogram** of the image manually.
- **Plot the histogram** to visualize the pixel intensity distribution.

#### 3. Calculate Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):
- **Compute the CDF** from the histogram.
- **Normalize the CDF** to the range [0, 255].

#### 4. Apply Histogram Equalization:
- **Map the original pixel values** to equalized pixel values using the CDF.
- **Display the equalized image** and plot its histogram.

#### 5. Compare Results:
- **Compare the original and equalized images.**
- **Discuss the differences** in visual quality and histogram distributions.

### Task 2: Comparing Histogram Equalization Techniques

#### Objective:
Compare standard histogram equalization with adaptive histogram equalization.

#### 1. Implement Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE):
- **Divide the image into smaller regions (tiles).**
- **Apply histogram equalization** to each tile separately.
- **Combine the tiles** to form the final image.

#### 2. Implement Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE):
- **Enhance the AHE implementation** by limiting the contrast.
- **Apply CLAHE** to the image and display the result.

#### 3. Compare Results:
- **Display the original image**, standard histogram equalized image, AHE image, and CLAHE image side by side.
- **Discuss the differences** in visual quality and histogram distributions.

#### 1. Separate Color Channels:
- **Split the color image** into its Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) channels.

#### 2. Apply Histogram Equalization to Each Channel:
- **Perform histogram equalization** on each color channel separately.

#### 3. Reconstruct the Color Image:
- **Combine the equalized color channels** to form the final image.

#### 4. Compare Results:
