Task 1: Basic Image Statistics and Color Space Conversion

Objective:
Compute basic statistics and convert an image into different color spaces.

Steps:
1. Read the Image: Load an image using OpenCV.

2. Compute Basic Statistics: Calculate the mean, standard deviation, and histogram of each color channel.

3. Convert Color Spaces: Convert the image to HSV and Lab color spaces and display the results.

Task 2: Simple Image Segmentation Using Thresholding

Objective:
Segment an image into foreground and background using global thresholding.

Steps:
1. Read the Image: Load a grayscale image.

2. Apply Thresholding: Use a fixed threshold value to segment the image.

3. Display Results: Show the original and segmented images.

Task 3: Color-Based Segmentation

Objective:
Segment specific objects in an image based on their color.

Steps:
1. Read the Image: Load an image with objects of different colors.

2. Convert to HSV: Convert the image to HSV color space.

3. Apply Color Thresholding: Use color thresholds to segment objects of a specific color.

4. Display Results: Show the original and segmented images.
